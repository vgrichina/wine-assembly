# WATX compiler — Wine-Assembly changelog

Divergence of this repository's vendored WATX compiler from its import point.
[PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md) records where the files came from and what they
hash to; this file records what we did to them afterwards.

Rules:

- Every change to a file listed in PROVENANCE.md's `sha256` block gets an entry
  here **and** an updated hash in the same commit. `tools/check-watx-provenance.js`
  fails the build otherwise.
- Prefer accepting valid standard WAT unconditionally over adding a
  `standardWat`-gated path (migration plan, §2.3).
- Every compiler change lands with a minimal regression in one of the
  `test/watx-compiler-*.test.js` suites.

## 2026-08-31 — import

Vendored from `../android-emu` `590238be` plus its uncommitted standard folded
`br_table` patch. Compiler files are byte-identical to that source.

Only adaptation: `test/watx-compiler-emit-stack.test.js` check (1) now reads
`tools/build.sh` and `tools/watx-baseline.sh` instead of android-emu's
`tools/build.js`, which does not exist in this repository. The asserted property
— no build path respawns Node with `--stack-size`, because a browser cannot — is
unchanged.

No compiler behavior change.

# Plus! 98 Screensavers — Progress

**Binaries:** `test/binaries/screensavers/` (19 screensavers from Plus! 98)
**Command-line:** `/s` = run screensaver, `/c` = config dialog, `/p <hwnd>` = preview
**Status:** Config dialogs work for all. 4/7 GDI savers render with sprites. 5 MFC42 savers reach the message loop. 7 D3D/DDraw savers run their game loop but produce only HUD/fade chrome — main mesh-render path is never entered (see Task 3).

### Organic Art (statically-linked DX framework, all 7 are the same 1,005,056-byte PE — `md5 fef9ed080d8cbb34df636f9c71b406cd`)
ARCHITEC / FALLINGL / GEOMETRY / JAZZ / OASAVER / ROCKROLL / SCIFI: Config OK; `/s` reaches the per-frame loop, but only emits a HUD quad + fade overlay via direct D3D2::DrawPrimitive. d3rm submits a single state-only Execute buffer per frame and never reaches its mesh-emission path. See Task 3.

## Open Tasks

### 1. FOXTROT white silhouettes (LOW)

Inconclusive after 2026-04-20 investigation: the 75×80 character sub-sprites in the 225×80 sheet have only white/gray/maroon palette entries in the source art. Either real Win98 used dynamic palette mapping we don't emulate, or the rendering is faithful and the original note misdiagnosed. Need a reference screenshot before further work.

### 2. CITYSCAP / PHODISC blank screens (MEDIUM)

- **PHODISC:** DIB blit no longer wipes canvas (sparse-hash sync fix shipped) — now shows desktop teal but no photos. Asset-load path not traced yet.
- **CITYSCAP:** Spins in GetMessageA without ever calling SetTimer/InvalidateRect. Render fn never runs. Probably missing a startup message or a registry value that gates rendering.

### 3. Organic Art savers — d3rm scene-root handler list is empty (HIGH, BLOCKED on runtime probe)

Active investigation. d3drm.dll is loaded as a guest PE (image base `0x64780000`, runtime base `0x7459b000`, delta `0xfe1b000`); its real x86 code runs on our emulator. `$handle_Direct3DRMCreate` is dead code in this configuration.

**Architectural facts (settled, don't re-litigate):**

- The 7 D3D savers are byte-identical; only the .SCN config differs.
- Scene-picker is NOT broken: `--trace-fs` confirms ROCKROLL loads its own assets (`ro_pick.x`, `ro_git.x`, `ro_tex01.gif`, `ro_back.GIF`). Earlier "lands on CA_CHROM" claims were stale. ROCKROLL.SCN has no `Active=` key at all yet still loads — `Active=` only gates the random CA_* pool. Stop chasing OrgSuppList.txt / scene-picker.
- Per-frame Execute buffers contain ONLY a 28-byte `STATETRANSFORM(count=3)` + 4-byte `EXIT` — never `PROCESSVERTICES` / `TRIANGLE` / `POINT` / `LINE`. All 205 Executes (across 40k batches) originate from d3rm-internal state-flush at `0x647c26a0` (file VA), not from a mesh-emit path.
- The only `DrawPrimitive` calls in the run come from the SCR EXE (`0x744217e7` HUD quad, `0x74420f28` full-screen fade overlay) — not from d3rm.
- App spends 95%+ of batches in a guest-internal MFC virtual method at `0x7440f38d` running a bump allocator (arena `0x744deed0`, bump ptr `[0x744deb9c]`, 4096-entry parallel arrays at `[0x744daa60]`/`[0x744d6a60]`). Almost certainly procedural mesh construction from SCN `Form/Branches/Ribs` params. The `call [ecx+0x64]` at `0x7440f3f2` is a guest-internal vtable dispatch, NOT host `IDirectDrawSurface2::Lock` (no host Lock fires in `--trace-api`).

**d3rm Tick path (mapped 2026-04-26):**
```
IDirect3DRM3::Tick (slot 34) → 0x647bc46a
  → enum frames + Move callbacks
  → enum devices → for each viewport:
      → 0x64798e51 (per-vp render)
        → 0x64798903 SCENE WALKER     [177 hits / 86 Flips]
            → visual-loop entry        [177]
              → non-Frame emit branch  [177]  visual ESI=0x75281d38
                → emit fn 0x647bc390   [177]  descriptor=0x647e0e78
                  → up-call [parent+0x38] = 0x647c52f9 → returns 0
                → fallback 0x745d73e6  [177]  no draw
```

**Class chain proven intact** (via `vtable_dump`): `0x647e0e78 → 0x647e0fe8 → 0x647e0fa0 → 0x647e0de0`. Slot 14 of parent = `0x647c52f9` (the polymorphic dispatcher).

**Dispatcher semantics inverted from HRESULT:**
```
0x647c52f9: call inner → neg eax; sbb eax, eax; and eax, [hr_cache]; ret
   = inner_returned_nonzero ? hr_cache : 0
```
Caller `0x647bc3db test eax,eax; jz fallback` treats 0 as "no handler found." `0x647e7afc` is the HRESULT accumulator (cleared on entry to many fns; OR'd with errors), NOT a sentinel.

**Inner walker `0x647c534f`** iterates `[arg3+0xbc]` entries (count) at base `[arg3+0xc4]`, stride **4 bytes** (pointer-array). Calls predicate `0x647ad71e(*entry, 0, ctx)` per entry; if nonzero, AddRef+invoke and writes a 0x50-byte result row into `[ebx+0xa0]`. Returns 0 if no entry matched.

**List ownership:** `[+0xbc]/[+0xc4]` belong to the **scene root frame** (scene_walker `arg0` → `ebx`), not the viewport. Confirmed by cross-checking dispatcher arg propagation from emit-fn call site `0x64798ac9` (`push ebx; push edi; push esi; call [eax+0x38]`) and by the in-walker pre-check at `0x64798955` reading `[ebx+0xbc]/[ebx+0xc4]` directly.

**The bug surface (current state):** across all of d3rm.dll, `find_field --op=write` shows **no instruction stores a nonzero value into `[reg+0xc4]`** — only zero-inits and one clone (copy-ctor at `0x647a3069` in fn `0x647a2f6d`):

| Writer VA | Fn entry | What it writes |
|---|---|---|
| `0x647a3069` | `0x647a2f6d` | clone: copies `[src+0xc4]` → `[dst+0xc4]` |
| `0x647a5cde` | `0x647a5c8d` | `0` (init) |
| `0x647aed61` | `0x647aed3b` | `0` (init) |
| `0x647c13f4` | `0x647c1377` | `0` (viewport zero-init) |

Field offset `+0xbc` is overloaded across object classes (count in some structs, doubly-linked-list `next` in others — e.g. `0x647acb4d` inside `0x647acace`), so pure offset-grep is noisy.

**Runtime probe (2026-04-26, ROCKROLL.SCR, runtime delta `0xfe1b000`):**

Object identification (corrected from earlier static analysis):
- `0x7500d6a0` = **viewport** (vtable `0x74e0fa58`; +0x3c/+0x40 = 640/480 = screen dims; +0x34 = scene-root back-pointer)
- `0x7500c368` = **scene-root frame** (vtable `0x74e0fc60`)

**Found the populator the static scan missed: `0x647c1c2b`.** Confirms field semantics: `+0xbc=count`, `+0xc0=capacity`, `+0xc4=array base`. `find_field --op=write` missed it because writes go through realloc helper + indexed store:

```
0x647c1ca1: mov eax,[esi+0xc0]       ; capacity
0x647c1cad: cmp [esi+0xbc],eax        ; if count==capacity:
0x647c1cb5:   add eax,3               ;   capacity += 3
0x647c1cb8:   mov [ecx],eax
0x647c1cbd:   push eax / shl eax,2 first
0x647c1cbe:   lea eax,[esi+0xc4]      ;   &array
0x647c1cc5:   call 0x6479c5f0         ;   realloc(&array, new_size_bytes)
0x647c1cdb: mov ecx,[esi+0xc4]        ; base
0x647c1ce1: mov [ecx+eax*4],edi       ; array[count] = entry
0x647c1ce4: inc [esi+0xbc]            ; count++
```

**Populator runtime behavior (trace-at on fn entry `0x745dcc2b`):** fires 6+ times per per-vp-render invocation (1 from `0x6479902f`, then recursive walks via `0x647c1d08` over `[ebx+0xa8]` sibling chain). Destination ESI = `0x7500d6a0` (viewport, NOT scene-root). At dispatcher hit, viewport `+0xbc=3, +0xc0=3, +0xc4=0x74e0ef50` (3 populated entries). Scene-root frame `0x7500c368` has `+0xbc=0xc0=0xc4=0` — it's a **separate, legitimately empty per-frame list**. (Initial `--break=0x745b402f --break-once` hit zero times because that VA is mid-block; trace-at on the populator's entry block instead.)

**So the prior "list is empty" diagnosis was probing the wrong object.** The viewport's draw list IS built each frame. The actual question is now: why does the dispatcher get called with `EBX=0x7500c368` (scene-root, empty by design) instead of with the viewport (which has 3 entries)?

Per-vp render `0x64798e51` flow (cleaned up):
- entry: `mov esi, [ebp+0x8]` → esi = viewport
- `mov edi, [esi+0x34]` → edi = scene-root frame
- gate `0x64798e9a: call 0x647c2792(esi)` — predicate; runtime returns 0 → continue (verified)
- `0x64798eca: and dword [esi+0xbc], 0` — zero viewport count for new frame
- `0x64798f35: call 0x647c1d30` — initial setup
- `0x64798fb6: mov eax,[ebx]; ... call [eax+0x40]` — vtable call (slot 0x40 of `[edi+0x5b8]`'s class)
- `0x6479901d: call 0x6479b235` — pre-populator hook
- `0x64799027: call 0x647c11f7` — produces source list
- `0x6479902f: call 0x647c1c2b` — populator (dest=viewport, src=eax of prev call) — **fires**

So the populator builds the viewport's draw list. Then per-vp render presumably issues the dispatcher walks afterwards. The dispatcher gets EBX=scene-root because scene-root IS the natural "walk root" for the scene_walker (`0x64798903`), but the dispatcher's inner walker `0x647c534f` looks at `[arg+0xbc]/[arg+0xc4]` of THIS arg (scene-root) — which is empty. The viewport's populated list is read from a different code path we haven't traced yet.

**Next-session pivot:**
1. Map who reads the viewport's `[+0xc4]` array. `find_field test/binaries/dlls/d3drm.dll 0xc4 --op=read` — the consumers are the actual draw-emission path. They must read from viewport (or from `[edi+0x5b8]` style indirection), not from scene-root.
2. Determine if scene_walker `0x64798903` is the right caller for the dispatcher in this code path, or if the viewport-list iteration is a different walker entirely. Look at fn `0x64798903` — does it iterate `[ebx+0xc4]` or call a vtable that does?
3. Identify d3rm's separate geometry-emission path: `0x647c3744` (generic `appendOp`) only writes 8-byte payloads via 3 callers — none emit PROCESSVERTICES / TRIANGLE. That writer must exist elsewhere; finding it tells us what guards mesh emission.

### 4. MFC screensavers — full DirectAnimation (DEFERRED)

CORBIS investigation (2026-04-20): the COM dependency isn't IPicture/OleLoadPicture but **DirectAnimation** (DAView + DAStatics from `danim.dll`). `CLSIDFromProgID(L"DirectAnimation.DAView"/L"DAStatics")` stubbed to `REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG`; app then crashes on a null vtable from an unpopulated DAView pointer. Bringing up even minimal DirectAnimation is larger than the existing DDraw work. FASHION/HORROR/WOTRAVEL share the framework.

`CLSIDFromProgID` returns `REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG`. `IDirectDrawFactory` (CLSID `0x4FD2A832`, ddrawex.dll) is short-circuited in `CoCreateInstance`; its 5 vtable methods (api_ids 1136–1140) delegate to existing DDraw wrappers. WIN98.SCR works via this path.

## Tooling — recently added (keep using)

- `tools/dump_va.js <pe> 0xVA[,...] [len]` — peek static PE/DLL bytes; explicitly tags BSS so a zeroed sentinel doesn't masquerade as initialized data.
- `tools/vtable_dump.js <pe> 0xVTBL_VA [n]` — enumerate N vtable slots with first-instruction disasm of each target.
- `--trace-dx-raw` (lib/host-imports.js case 8) — hex-dumps the full Execute-buffer instruction stream, not just the walker's parse. Reusable for any future d3rm/d3dim investigation.
- `--trace-at-dump=ADDR:LEN[,...]` — per-hit memory snapshot; pair with `--trace-at-watch` for diff-vs-previous.
- `[dx] ExecIn` formatter (lib/host-imports.js:4397) annotates each Execute with `caller=<retAddr>` so the originating wrapper is identifiable in one glance.

## Completed (for reference; details in git log)

- **InSendMessage / EnumWindows + ESP cleanup** — fixed ESP drift across stdcall handlers; unblocked 7 DDraw savers' MFC init.
- **DirectDraw QI AddRef** — QI must AddRef even when returning the same wrapper, otherwise Release frees the DX_OBJECTS slot. Unblocked WIN98.SCR rendering.
- **Sprite SRCAND/SRCPAINT compositing** — black silhouettes → correct colors (PEANUTS/CATHY/DOONBURY).
- **MFC42 CBT hook stack fix** — CACA0002 missing saved_ret/saved_hwnd pushes; unblocked CORBIS/FASHION/HORROR/WIN98/WOTRAVEL message loop.
- **THREAD_BASE moved out of thunk zone** — was 0x01D52000, now 0x01E52000.
- **D3D init crashes** (sessions 2026-04-18 a..j): "No valid modes" CA::DXException — root-caused to GetSurfaceDesc reporting SYSTEMMEMORY caps for Z-buffers. Plus IDirect3D2 QI returning D3D3 vtable, IDirect3D2::CreateDevice returning DEV3 vtable, GetPalette error triggering DXException, COM-wrapper vtable mutation replaced with aux-wrapper pool. All shipped.
- **TLS via fs:[0x2c]** — MFC string helpers read TLS array via direct FS-segment access, never call TlsGetValue. Eagerly allocate `$tls_slots` and set `fs_base+0x2c` in `$enter_entry_point`.
- **fs_search_path arg-order bug** — `writeStr(bufGA, full, bufLen, isWide)` consumed `bufLen` as `isWide`, so SearchPath results were UTF-16-encoded. Fixed.
- **IDirectDrawSurface2 GetDDInterface / PageLock / PageUnlock** — `esp += 8` instead of `esp += 12` caused -4 ESP drift; downstream `pop edi` read wrong slot, manifested as a phantom EDI corruption across an unrelated callee.
- **QI for Texture2 / DDSurface must upgrade vtable** — DX3-compat "return same wrapper for any QI" broke Texture2→DDSurface roundtrips. Now uses aux-wrapper pool keyed by IID.
- **SEH walker fix** — `frame_ebp = seh_rec + 0x10` (was `+0xC`) for the 5-dword MSVC `__SEH_prolog4` layout; also reset `$steps=0` on unwind so `$th_call` doesn't clobber the unwind target. Apps with top-level MFC `__except` handlers now exit cleanly.
- **dibSection sparse-hash sync** — `_syncDibSection` no longer wipes the canvas on every BitBlt source resolution. Unblocked PHODISC's desktop-color render.
- **GetClipBox / Timer ID 0 / SetStretchBltMode / GetBkColor / GetTextColor / GdiFlush / PlaySoundA stub** — implemented.
